Vignette 1A. Vignette 1A will describe a case of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The case should meet the diagnostic requirements of ICD-11, but does not necessarily have to include every feature.

PK
 
Referral
 
PK is a 36-year-old woman who lives with her husband and two young daughters, ages 7 and 10, and works in a government office. Last week, she went to see a gastroenterologist with complaints of chronic stomach pain and was diagnosed with an ulcer. In an attempt to identify potential causes of the ulcer, the gastroenterologist asked PK about her stress level. PK mentioned that she had been feeling extremely nervous and worried during the past couple of years, even though nothing unusual or bad has happened. The gastroenterologist suggested that PK speak to a mental health professional to help her manage her anxiety.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During the initial mental health evaluation, PK admits that she worries almost all the time, and now she is concerned that her worry is damaging her health. PK says that she has always been “a worrier” and that she thinks that this quality has helped her to be attentive to her family and conscientious in her job.  However, she says that during the past couple of years it has gotten “out of control” and she worries to the point that she feels overwhelmed and exhausted.  When asked what she worries about, she says, “It could be anything—whether my kids might get sick, whether I locked the front door, whether I can finish a report for work on time—whatever I am thinking about can be something to worry about.” She provides the example of when her daughters have a minor cold, she worries that it will turn into something serious to the extent that she has to take them to the doctor, even though she knows that they are in good health overall and that all children get colds. As another example, PK says that her husband is very social and often invites his co-workers over for dinner, which PK says “really stresses her out” because she worries that the meal will turn out badly and that this will somehow damage her husband’s career.
 
On most days, she finds it very difficult to sleep, as she lies in bed thinking about all the things she has to do the next day, and worries that she will not be able to get everything done.  She feels very tense, and often has pain in her shoulders and upper back that she recognizes comes from the tension.
 
PK reports that she and her husband have a good relationship, but have been arguing recently because of her always being so tense and on edge. Her older daughter has recently said that she is not going to tell PK anything from now on because PK “makes such a big deal out of everything.” PK says that she used to be able to let go and have fun with her family, but has found this impossible over the past couple of years. She says, “They are getting as tired of it as I am.”
 
Additional Background Information
 
PK is an only child.  Her parents divorced when she was very young, and she grew up with her mother and grandparents. She takes no medications other than antacids for her ulcer.  She very rarely drinks alcohol—usually only one glass of wine—and has never taken drugs.  Her recent medical exam revealed no abnormalities other than her ulcer.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS:  ICD-11: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 




Vignette 1B. TS

Referral
 
TS is a 44-year-old woman, who is married and has three school-aged children and works as a lawyer. She has sought consultation with a psychologist “to get advice on how to maintain a healthy balance between her career and family.”
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During the initial assessment, TS reports that she has been “quite stressed” off and on for the past year since she received a promotion at the law firm where she works. TS was excited about the promotion but finds that her substantially increased responsibilities can be overwhelming. TS says that she “worries a lot” about whether she will be able to perform at a high enough standard and get everything done. She describes herself as “sort of a control freak” and extremely detail-oriented, but says that these qualities help her to meet deadlines and produce superior work. Lately, however, she has been concerned that her level of stress may be interfering with her ability to focus at work and putting a strain on her family. She says that, while her performance evaluations at work have been very positive, she now has less time to spend with her husband, and often has to do multiple things at once such as doing her own work at the same time she is helping her children with their homework.
 
During the interview, TS reports that she has never worried enough to be “physically ill,” though she does feel very tense at times. When asked how she experiences the tension, she clarifies that it is “more of an emotional kind of tension, not physical tension.” She does not have difficulty sleeping, as she claims that “at the end of the day, I feel so tired that I am not able to think about anything else other than my bed.” When thoughts about everything she has to do “get to be too much” she repeats to herself, “Just breathe and push through it.” She is usually able to calm herself in that way. On weekends, she tries to avoid working in order to spend time with her family, although this has been less possible during the past year.
 
She reports that despite her workload and worries, she is handling things “pretty well, overall” and is able to complete work assignments and manage at home, though her husband has to help more than before. TS says that her relationship with her husband is “very strong” and that he is supportive, but she feels bad about neglecting him since she started her new job. In addition, TS complains that she does not have adequate time “just for herself.” For example, she used to exercise regularly but has had much less time to do so since she received the promotion at work. She is afraid that her new schedule will soon exhaust her, unless she “learns some helpful skills” to balance her life and lessen her worries related to her work.
 
Additional Background Information
 
TS is the oldest of four children. Her mother was an art teacher and her father was a judge who TS describes as being “brilliant and highly ambitious.” She usually drinks a glass of wine with her husband at night, but denies using any other substances. Her recent routine blood and medical tests revealed no abnormalities.
CORRECT DIAGNOSIS:  ICD-11: no diagnosis




Vignette 2. Vignette 2 will be a case of Panic Disorder. It should meet all diagnostic requirements for ICD-11. Specifically, it should be clear that the individual’s panic attacks are unexpected (i.e., not clearly associated with a specific situation), and the individual’s primary concern is about future attacks. 

MT
 
Referral
 
MT is a 23-year-old woman who lives alone and is a graduate student at a local university. She was referred for psychiatric evaluation by an emergency room physician, at the university hospital, who attended her during her second visit to the emergency department within a 2-month period. According to hospital records, on both occasions MT complained of severe chest pain, dizziness, and a tingling sensation in her arms and legs and thought she was having a heart attack.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During the psychiatric evaluation, MT explains that she has experienced several big life changes recently, including breaking up with her boyfriend and moving to her current city 4 months ago to enroll in graduate school. However, she reports that the episodes of being “extremely fearful and feeling like she was dying” started approximately 9 months before that, prior to the breakup and her move. The first time, she was out walking with her father and suddenly started feeling extremely apprehensive and fearful, “for no reason.”  Over the next few minutes, as the feeling got worse, she began to feel dizzy and started having trouble breathing. She says her heart was racing and her fingertips started tingling, and she felt a tightness in her chest. She thought she was having a heart attack and was going to die, so her father rushed her to the nearest emergency room. After 30 minutes in the hospital, she “felt okay again,” but was shaken by what had happened. After several examinations, she was found to be in good health and doctors could not identify any cardiovascular abnormality, or other cause, for her symptoms.
 
Since then, MT has had multiple similar episodes of sudden, intense feelings of anxiety, “like the world is about to end,” and the same physiological sensations.  She is not able to identify any precipitating event for the episodes; they have usually happened when she has been on a walk or studying. She indicates that she was not thinking about any particular topic when the episodes occurred. She finds herself worrying about having another episode to such an extent that she has major difficulty focusing on her schoolwork.
 
She says that her move has made her even more terrified that she would have another episode, and that the effects would be even worse because she does not have family or close friends nearby. So, when she had her first episode after moving, she went to the university hospital. “I thought I was dying and I didn’t know what else to do.” During her most recent trip to the university hospital emergency room, the attending physician recognized her and told her that there was nothing wrong with her heart, and that she needed to see a psychiatrist. She states that she decided to attend this psychiatric evaluation because, not only is she exhausted by the emotional impact of her condition, but the mounting costs of her ER visits have become so burdensome that she is unable to pay her university fees.
 
Additional Background Information
 
MT reports that she drinks alcohol occasionally, consuming two or three drinks with friends on weekends, but says that she does not smoke or use substances. She is doing well in school, but says that she is afraid that she will have to leave school and move back home if the episodes continue. “That is, if they don’t kill me.”

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Panic Disorder




Vignette 3A. Vignette 3A will be a case of pure Agoraphobia. The individual will express fear of multiple public situations because of an inability to escape from the situation. The person should fear some dangerous outcome, but should not have any associated panic attacks. 

PF
 
Referral
 
PF is a 53-year-old unmarried man presenting for psychiatric evaluation at the local community mental health clinic. PF is currently unemployed and lives with his brother, who accompanied PF to the evaluation.  PF’s brother has insisted that PF seek help for his unmanageable fear of going out alone, which has worsened over the past 6 months.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
PF has long had a sense of uneasiness and anxiety in crowded places, such as theatres or markets, and also while using public transportation. About a year ago, when he was coming home from work, he got so nervous because of all the people on the bus that he begged the bus driver to let him off between stops. He was quite shaken afterwards, and had to call his brother to come pick him up. He states that the episode was extremely humiliating to him because “everyone was staring at me, thinking I must be crazy.” After that, he stopped travelling by public transport.
 
Until 6 months ago, PF worked as a computer technician in a local company. At that time, he was supposed to travel to another city to attend a large convention for his work. He tried to persuade his brother to travel with him, but his brother could not leave his own work. PF felt incredibly anxious about the trip for days in advance. He described a feeling of dread at the idea of being trapped in the crowded Convention Centre, with no way to get out and no one to help him. Rather than attending the convention, he simply stopped going to work and was eventually fired. He has not worked since then.
 
In recent months, PF’s movements and activities have become increasingly restricted. While PF claims that he can venture out alone within his own neighborhood, as long as he avoids places that might be crowded, PF’s brother disputes this. According to PF’s brother, PF only leaves the house under great pressure, and only if he accompanies him.
 
When asked what he fears about going to crowded or unfamiliar locations, PF says, “What if I can’t get out, because there are too many people, or I don’t know how? I would be trapped. Trapped like a rat.”  He states emphatically that he does not want to be humiliated again, like he was that time on the bus. 
 
In response to more detailed questions about his physical sensations during the episode on the bus, and at other times when he has he felt anxious in response to being in crowded places, PF does not remember experiencing any symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, or shortness of breath on those occasions.
 
Additional Background Information
 
PF is a regular cigarette smoker and a moderate user of alcohol, but does not use other drugs. PF and his brother were raised by his mother after their father died of cancer when they were children. PF’s mother died 10 years ago, and PF and his brother continue to live in the same house.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Agoraphobia





Vignette 3B. Vignette 3B will be a case of Agoraphobia with associated panic attacks. The individual’s fear of social situations will include fear of having a panic attack in those situations. However, it should be clear that the individual does not meet diagnostic guidelines for Panic Disorder, because the attacks are situationally cued and the person’s anxiety is focused on escape from situations and the possibility that no one will be able to help them if they experience symptoms rather than on having a panic attack and concern about the dangerousness of the attendant symptoms.

AM

Referral
 
AM, a 25-year-old website designer, was brought to the local community health center by her closest friend to be evaluated because of severe anxiety symptoms that have kept AM housebound for the past two months.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
AM insists that her friend remain with her for the interview with the psychologist. When asked what might happen if her friend were to leave, AM becomes very agitated and flushed and blurts out, “I don’t know this place, and my friend is the only person who can help me if I feel sick and need to get out.” Her friend immediately reassures her that she will be fine, and suggests that AM explain what has led her to become housebound. AM regains her composure and starts to explain that she has always been uncomfortable being alone in crowded, public places like bus stations and shopping malls.
 
AM reveals that 2 years ago, she went to pick up an important parcel at the post office. When she got to the post office, “there were a lot of people there.” She suddenly started to feel extremely anxious, “like something bad was going to happen.” Her heart rate increased, she felt dizzy, faint, nauseous, and she started hyperventilating. She says she was sure she was going to die. She immediately ran outside crying and called her cousin, who lives nearby, to come pick her up and take her home. After she got home, she felt fine, but she found the experience to be deeply troubling.
 
Since then, AM has had several more of these “bad episodes,” usually when she was forced to go out in public alone. AM began to feel constantly nervous that these “breakdowns” would occur again.  About 2 months ago she was at a close friend’s birthday party and found it to be very crowded.  She again felt terrified and had all of the same physical symptoms as she had experienced at the post office. She says, “it was the worst one so far,” and was just “too much” because being with her friends did not protect her. Since then, she says that she has preferred to stay home. She has never had a similar episode at home, even when a group of people has come to visit. She is very concerned that if she feels sick or dizzy while she is away from home, she will not know who to go to for help, and as a result may faint or die. She states that “fortunately, I work from home and can have my groceries delivered, so there is really no reason for me to take the risk of having another breakdown,” which is “the worst feeling in the world.”  Though AM says that she is “really okay with not going anywhere,” she has lost several job opportunities that required face-to-face interviews and admits that she is beginning to struggle financially.
 
Additional Background Information
 
AM is single, but was in a serious relationship that ended a year ago. She does not smoke or use drugs, but drinks alcohol a couple of times a week. Her most recent medical examination showed that she was in good health.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Agoraphobia





Vignette 4. Vignette 4 will be a case of Specific Phobia that meets all ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. The specific focus of the phobia does not matter, but should represent a common fear that occurs in most cultures. Avoid blood-injection phobia because of possible confusion with other medical conditions.

MJ
 
Referral
 
MJ is a 19-year-old female in the first year of university, who works part-time at a coffee shop located on the university campus. MJ presents herself to the clinic because she is “exhausted by her odd and intense fear” of lightning and thunderstorms. MJ reports that she remembers always being nervous about lightning, thunder, and high winds. However, this fear has become much more intense over the last 10 months since she moved to attend university in a coastal town that often experiences bad weather.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During her initial evaluation, MJ is cooperative and engaged. She indicates that she “needs some major help” dealing with her intense fear of storms. She says that she is constantly worrying about the weather and checks the forecast multiple times a day. She indicates that if she thinks the wind is blowing too strongly, or if there is lightning and thunder, she “just cannot” leave her dormitory. This has caused her to miss several classes; she is currently failing one of her classes because she missed an exam on a stormy day. When discussing her missed classes, MJ appears distressed and anxious, and avoids eye contact with the therapist.
 
MJ had been on the girls’ soccer team at her former school, and she missed matches a few times because of the weather forecast, but this was never very noticeable because “usually they would cancel the game in advance.”  She says she still enjoys being outside when the weather is clear.  She goes running and enjoys going out with her friends.  When the weather is bad, her friends often agree to accompany her outside, “but it still really freaks me out.”  About a week ago, she was forced to leave the dormitory during a storm because the fire alarm went off. This was extremely distressing to her, and she felt intensely fearful the entire time she was outside (about 30 minutes). About an hour after returning to her room, MJ felt a bit better but needed her roommate to stay by her side until she fell asleep. She says her friends do not really understand why she is so scared of the storms, and some of them seem to be getting more irritated that they have to “babysit” her all the time. When asked about how often this is occurring, MJ averts her gaze to the floor.  After a few moments, she says, “I am just tired of being afraid. I want it to get better.” 
 
Additional Background Information
 
MJ has two younger siblings. Her parents are divorced. She grew up in a city that rarely has severe weather. When asked, MJ reports that neither she, nor any one she knows, was ever caught or hurt in a severe storm. She recently had a routine check-up at the student health clinic and everything was found to be normal. She does not drink or do drugs, but admits to smoking a few cigarettes a week, “to calm my nerves.”

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS:  ICD-11: Specific Phobia






Vignette 5A. Vignette 5A will be a case of pure Social Anxiety Disorder. The individual will meet all ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines, but there should be no mention of the person’s anxiety reaching the level of a panic attack.

TM

Referral
 
TM is a 16-year-old male student who lives with his mother and younger sister. TM was brought for evaluation at the university psychiatric clinic by his mother because of her concern about TM’s frequent absences from school.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During the evaluation, TM does not readily make eye contact with the clinician and remains quiet during the first part of the session. TM’s mother reports TM has always been a “shy but likeable kid.” His avoidance of going to school started at the beginning of the current school year, about 8 months ago, after his family moved and he started attending a new school.
 
On most school mornings, TM begs her to let him stay home. TM’s mother tries to force him to go, but says that “sometimes it is just too much of a battle.” She became seriously concerned when the school notified her that he had missed several school days when she thought he had gone to school. TM is not doing well in school because, in addition to his many absences, when the teacher calls on him, he says “I just freeze. Even if I know the answer, I can’t say it. I just turn all red and look like an idiot.”
 
TM admits that he has always had a hard time talking to people he doesn’t know well. He had a few friends at his former school because “I was at the same school my whole life and we all knew each other.” He is having great difficulty making friends at his new school, because he is worried that the other kids think he is “a total loser.” TM thinks about this all the time and says he has trouble sleeping because of it. He would like to have friends and be popular, and wishes he could be more relaxed and confident enough to interact with new people.
 
TM’s mother mentions that TM spends most evenings and weekends reading or playing video games in his room, activities that he says he enjoys thoroughly. TM used to play soccer at his old school, and was considered a good player. However, he has been unable to introduce himself to the coach at the new school, and try out for the team, because he would have to do this in front of the other players. He is worried that he would do a bad job during the try-out because of his nervousness, and the other players would look down on him for not being good enough.
 
TM’s mother reports that she was initially concerned that TM was being bullied at school, but after speaking with his teachers and parents of classmates, she found no indication that he was being harassed. TM eventually responds, “No, it’s not them. It’s me.”
 
Additional Backgroud Information
 
TM’s parents are divorced and his father lives in another city, but they speak over the phone several times a week. After his mother is asked to leave the room, TM reports that he does not use drugs, but does admit that he has drunk alcohol on several occasions and once smoked a cigarette. At a recent check-up, TM’s family doctor found him to be in good health.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Social Anxiety Disorder






Vignette 5B. Vignette 5B will be a case of Social Anxiety Disorder that also displays regular panic attacks in or in anticipation of social evaluative situations. It should be clear that the panic attacks are always situationally cued, and thus are not unexpected. There is no focus of concern on the panic per se, the person’s anxiety is focused on the evaluative nature of the situation, such that people might notice the symptoms of anxiety and judge the person negatively on that basis.

JL

Referral
 
JL is a 28-year-old mother of two young children who was referred by her family physician for a psychiatric evaluation due to reported episodes of extreme anxiety that have made it difficult for her to accomplish her daily tasks.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
During the interview, JL reports that she is happily married and is proud to be caring full time for her daughter and son, aged 2 and 8. She indicates that she works hard to ensure that her family is well cared for, accomplishing her household chores with thoughtfulness and special attention (e.g., buying healthy food and preparing wholesome meals, researching interesting crafts to do with her children, tidying the house every day).
 
JL says that her current difficulties began when her son started primary school two years ago, and her regular routine was disrupted because she had to pick him up at the end of the school day. When the psychiatrist asks JL why this was disruptive, she replies that she often has to wait for her son among the other parents and make “small talk.” She indicates that she “dreads” these exchanges because she feels that the other parents judge what she says as “stupid.” However, when asked, she could not provide a specific example of something that any of the parents said that was judgmental.
 
JL’s son attends a school where parents are expected to volunteer, and JL wants to do this “to be a good mother.”  Since the middle of the school year, JL has acted as a lunch monitor twice a week with several other parents. She describes this activity as “hell on earth” and reports that on a number of occasions she has experienced “the worst anxiety imaginable.” She states that several times, when talking with the other parents, she has experienced a lot of “distressing” symptoms that come on suddenly, including feeling shaky, faint, heart palpitations, and a sensation that she is “outside of her body.”  Now, she has started to feel very anxious that she will have another episode from the time she wakes up on the days she is scheduled to volunteer at the school, and says, “I don’t want to put myself through that.”  On several occasions, she has called the school to say that she did not feel well and could not come in. She thinks that this will make others’ judgments of her even worse. She notes that she only experiences these symptoms of extreme anxiety when interacting with the other parents.
 
JL says that she prefers to stay at home and care for the children. She is happy to spend time with her small group of friends that she has known for many years, but when she attends parties, or other social engagements, she says, “I don’t really enjoy it. I just don’t like having to talk to people I don’t know. I never know what to say and they probably think I am stupid.”
 
Additional Background Information
 
JL reports that she has always been in good health, except for an appendectomy 10 years ago. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and has never used any substances.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Social Anxiety Disorder




Vignette 5C. JV
 
Referral
 
JV is a 22-year-old female university student. She presented to her university’s counselling center because of difficulty she is anticipating in her public speaking class.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
In her initial session, JV explains that she is very concerned of having to give a speech in front of a class. The university requires that she take a public speaking course in order to graduate; she says she has postponed taking the class until her final year in school because she dreads the idea of it. However, she knows that she needs to find a way to complete it in order to finish her degree. She came to the counselling center in hopes of finding a way to cope with her anxiety about giving the speech. She explains that she has always been a shy person, and feels uncomfortable if she is the center of attention.
 
JV’s teachers consider her to be a quiet but capable student. She says that she rarely raises her hand in class, but she will answer if she were called upon. She has had to give brief presentations in other classes, and has been able to somehow get through it, but it has always made her uncomfortable. She states that she feels very nervous before a presentation, with “butterflies in her stomach,” but calms down quickly after it is finished. However, she has never had to give a presentation to a group as large as the public speaking course with such important consequences, and feels quite anxious that she will not be able to perform satisfactorily and will therefore not be able to graduate.
 
JV reports that she has a group of friends, but has never been “the talkative one.” JV likes to do things with the group, but rarely speaks up because she finds it hard to break into the stream of conversation. Usually, she prefers to listen. When the clinician asks JV if she is experiencing any anxiety in the current session, JV replies that she feels fine. She elaborates that she usually does well in one-on-one situations; she only starts to feel uncomfortable when the group gets larger, “like more than 5 or 6 people.” She has a boyfriend, and she reports that the relationship is going well. She says he has a similar preference for small groups and quiet activities. When the clinician asks if she would like to change her shyness, JV states that it usually does not cause her any problems and she likes who she is as a person. She emphasizes that her only concern is making it through her required speech course. She says she is ready to tackle the problem, but wants some support and suggestions for how to do so.
 
Additional Background Information
 
JV is an only child whose parents had her relatively late in life and live in a nearby town. She describes her family life as “quiet but normal.” She denies using any drugs, but states that she occasionally drinks one or two alcoholic beverages with her boyfriend on the weekends. A recent physical examination revealed no abnormalities.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS:  ICD-11: no diagnosis



Vignette 6A. Vignette 6A will be a child case of Separation Anxiety Disorder. The age of the individual should be a child young enough to be representative of individuals with the disorder, but old enough that in most cultures that level of separation anxiety would be considered abnormal.

VK

Referral
 
VK is a 10-year-old schoolgirl. She is brought to the clinic for counseling by her mother, who states that VK throws severe tantrums and gets excessively distressed whenever she leaves VK’s side. This behaviour has escalated over the last year, to the point that VK’s parents have become exhausted and do not know how to help their daughter. VK’s school nurse suggested that VK be taken to a counsellor.
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
VK’s mother mentions that VK’s behaviour has been problematic since she started school 5 years ago. At that time, VK would weep almost daily on school mornings, as she did not want to leave her mother. She would have to be carried “crying and screaming” to the school bus. During the school holidays, VK would sometimes stay with her grandparents during the day, but would constantly plead to go to work with her mother. When her mother would force her to stay with her grandparents, VK would continue crying and yelling for up to an hour, and would insist on calling her mother several times a day in order to speak with her.
 
At present, VK still appears anxious when she has to board the school bus, and she often complains of feeling nauseous and ill on school mornings. She occasionally asks to visit the school clinic because she has a stomachache or feels like she is going to vomit, and says she needs her mother to come pick her up. VK insists calling her mother at work from the school office about 2-3 times a day. If her mother is a few minutes late to pick her up from school, VK becomes extremely anxious and fearful and often cries. VK recently refused to go on a class trip that involved staying away from home for a night. She does not play with friends in the playground if her mother is not there. As a result, she has few friends besides her cousins. She enjoys being with her maternal aunt and cousins, but refuses to sleep at their house, away from her mother. 
 
VK states she loves her father and grandparents but feels “very close” to her mother. When asked why it is so difficult to be away from her mother, VK whispers, “Because something might happen to her and she won’t come home.” She does not have such fears when her mother is near her.
 
Additional Background Information
 
VK is an only child. VK’s mother stated that VK met all developmental milestones on time, but was a “clingy” child. Sleep training was especially difficult because VK insisted on sleeping with her parents. VK has had no other health problems and is not on any medications. VK’s parents have both always been in good health.

CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Separation Anxiety Disorder







Vignette 6B. Vignette 6B will be an adult case of Separation Anxiety Disorder. The person should express the separation anxiety regarding a developmentally appropriate relationship (e.g., a romantic partner). Otherwise, the symptoms presented in the case should be similar in number and severity to 6A. The person should not satisfy the diagnostic requirements for Dependent Personality Disorder in ICD-10.

AG

Referral
 
AG and his wife were referred to a psychologist by their family physician for marital counseling. They are both in their mid-30s and have been married for 9 years. They have no children. AG’s wife raised concerns with her physician that her relationship with her husband has deteriorated because she feels he is “smothering her” and refuses to “give her space.”
 
Presenting Symptoms
 
AG and his wife attend an initial intake session together and appear tense. AG’s wife starts recounting her concerns related to her husband’s behaviour, saying that the trouble started 3 years ago when she switched jobs to a sales position that involved travelling several times a month. After the first few business trips with no incident, AG started to insist that his wife call home immediately after she landed at her destination, and then again when she arrived at her hotel. AG’s wife complains that, before each trip, AG pleads with her not to go. She feels this is extremely unfair because he knew that traveling was going to be a part of her new job and they had discussed this prior to her accepting the job. AG’s wife says that her husband’s behavior is so disruptive that she thinks she will have to get another job that does not require traveling. She thinks his behaviour is unreasonable, and she is resentful that he is disrupting her ability to have the career she always wanted.
 
AG explains to the psychologist that, even though he knows it is irrational, he is terrified that his wife will be injured or killed when she is away on business. While she is away, he reports that he can barely sleep through the night and will often wake up “in a cold sweat.” Several times, he has called her hotel room in the middle of the night to make sure she is still alive. Even when she is not traveling, AG texts his wife several times a day to make sure she is okay. If she does not respond immediately, he calls his wife’s office and mobile phone repeatedly until she answers.
 
AG’s wife describes how her relationship with her husband has always been very passionate and at first she considered his behavior a sign of his deep affection. AG interrupts and says, “You know how much I love you. I just don’t want to lose you.” AG’s wife quickly responds, saying, “How can you lose me when you never let me out of your sight!”  AG’s wife says that throughout their relationship AG has always wanted to spend all their free time together and that he has always been somewhat insecure, but now it has gotten out of hand.  At the same time, AG’s wife indicates that he has always been confident in making decisions about his own life, and she does not experience AG as controlling of her decisions and behaviours except insofar as they involve her being away from him. AG reports that he knows his wife is frustrated by his behaviour when she travels. He does not want to anger her, but he cannot stop himself because he is so afraid that something might happen.
