#A1 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
          
##Essential (Required) Features: 

Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature.  Such events include, but are not limited to, natural or human-made disasters; combat; serious accidents; torture; sexual violence; terrorism; assault; acute life-threatening illness (such as a heart attack); witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected, or violent manner; and experiencing the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one. Following the traumatic event or situation (generally within 1 month but nearly always within several months), the development of a characteristic syndrome consisting of three core elements:  Re-experiencing the traumatic event in the present, in which the event(s) is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now.  This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive images or memories; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event(s). Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and physical sensations. Deliberate avoidance of reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s). This may take the form either of active internal avoidance of relevant thoughts and memories, or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities, or situations reminiscent of the event(s). In extreme cases the person may change his or her environment (e.g., move to a different city or change jobs) to avoid reminders. Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to events such as unexpected noises. Hypervigilant persons constantly guard themselves against danger and feel themselves or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally.  They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g., only sit in certain places on trains, repeatedly check in vehicles’ rear-view mirror). 

#A2 Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
                   
##Essential (Required) Features: 

History of exposure to a stressor of an extreme and prolonged or repetitive nature from which escape is difficult or impossible.  Such events include, but are not limited to, torture, concentration camps, slavery, genocide campaigns and other forms of organized violence, prolonged domestic violence, and repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse. History of the following three core elements of PTSD that developed during or after the traumatic event (generally within one month but nearly always within several months) and lasting for at least several weeks: Re-experiencing the traumatic event after the traumatic event has occurred, in which the event(s) is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now.  This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive images or memories; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event(s). Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and physical sensations. Deliberate avoidance of reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s). This may take the form either of active internal avoidance of relevant thoughts and memories, or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities, or situations reminiscent of the event(s). In extreme cases the person may change his or her environment (e.g., move house or change jobs) to avoid reminders. Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to events such as unexpected noises. Hypervigilant persons constantly guard themselves against danger and feel themselves or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally.  They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g., only sit in certain places on trains, repeatedly check in vehicles’ rear-view mirror). Severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation.  Examples include heightened emotional reactivity to minor stressors, violent outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behavior, dissociative symptoms when under stress, and emotional numbing, particularly the inability to experience pleasure or positive emotions. Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by deep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor.  For example, the individual may feel guilty about not having escaped from or succumbing to the adverse circumstance, or not having been able to prevent the suffering of others. Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. The person may consistently avoid, deride or have little interest in relationships and social engagement more generally. Alternatively, there may be occasional intense relationships, but the person has difficulty sustaining them.    

#A3 Prolonged Grief Disorder
          
##Essential (Required) Features:

History of bereavement following the death of a partner, parent, child, or close other person. A persistent and severe grief response that includes severe separation distress, characterized by yearning, sadness, or longing for the deceased, and associated emotional pain (e.g., guilt; denial; blame; an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness). The grief response has persisted for an abnormally long period of time following the loss, clearly beyond the normative response for grieving within the individuals’ religious and cultural context.   

#A4 Adjustment Disorder
            
##Essential (Required) Features:       

A maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors (e.g., single stressful event, ongoing psychosocial difficulty or a combination of stressful life situations) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor. Examples include divorce, illness or disability, socio-economic problems and conflicts at home or work. The reaction to the stressor is characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications. Failure to adapt to the stressor produces noticeable impairment in personal, social or occupational functioning, e.g., relationship conflict, performance problems at work or school, reduced ability to respond appropriately to normal stressors.  

#A5 Other Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress
             
A diagnosis of Other Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress should be used only in cases in which: 
The clinical presentation does not satisfy the definitional requirements of any of the other disorders in this section or of Acute Stress Reaction; The symptoms are not better explained by another Mental and Behavioural Disorder (e.g., a depressive or anxiety disorder); The clinical presentation is judged to be a Mental and Behavioural Disorder occurring in specific association with an identifiable stressor; The symptoms cause distress or functional impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.  

#A6 Acute Stress Reaction
             
Note:  Acute Stress Reaction is not considered to be a Mental and Behavioural Disorder, but rather appears in the section that lists reasons for clinical encounters that are not diseases or disorders.  It is listed here to assist in differential diagnosis.
             
##Essential (Required) Features:       
Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature.  Such events include, but are not limited to, natural or human-made disasters; combat; serious accidents; torture; sexual violence; terrorism; assault; acute life-threatening illness (such as a heart attack); witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected, or violent manner; and experiencing the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one. The development of a response to the stressor which is considered to be normal given the severity of the stressor. The response to the stressor may include transient emotional, somatic, cognitive, or behavioural symptoms, such as being in a daze, confusion, sadness, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, inactivity, social withdrawal, or stupor. Autonomic signs of anxiety (e.g., tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are commonly present and may be the presenting feature. Symptoms typically appear within hours to days following the stressful event, and usually begin to subside within a few days after the event or following removal from the threatening situation, when this is possible. In cases where the stressor continues or removal is not possible, symptoms may persist but are usually greatly reduced within approximately 1 month as the person adapts to the changed situation.  

# Vignette: 
OG, a 31-year-old man, sought a consultation due to having lost his job three months ago. After several years working as a manager at a financial institution, he was fired abruptly as a part of a company restructuring. He has tried to find a new job but failed. When he is not looking for a job, he spends his time exercising or doing things around the apartment.
  
## Presenting Symptoms:
He reports feelings of failure, loneliness and futility. He is concerned that having been fired from his job, even though it was not his fault, will make other financial institutions reluctant to hire him, and is afraid he will never be able to get another job in his chosen field.  He says that it has been difficult for him to reorganize his time, in particular during the day when other people are at work. In the previous three months, he often met with former co-workers who were discharged as well. They had been planning to claim additional financial compensation from their former employer, but OG has concluded that this vague plan is unlikely to be successful and prefers to move on.  OG’s financial resources are decreasing, and he is ashamed that he may have to ask his parents to help support him financially again. He reports fearing that his relationship with his girlfriend, who works in the same financial institution, will deteriorate. He fears she will leave him because he is a “jobless loser”.  She denies any such intention, or that there has been any change in their relationship.  She has encouraged him to seek mental health treatment before they do actually begin to experience problems. In the consultation interview, OG admits that his alcohol consumption has increased during the last three months, but it has not reached the level of harmful use. He reports with pride that he still carries out his daily routine and time schedule. He reports having experienced one panic attack (of indistinct duration) around ten days after being discharged from his job. It has not recurred and he denies fear of future attacks.  He reports feelings of failure and negative self-evaluation related to losing his job, but denies pervasive symptoms of depression.
  
## Additional Background Information:
OG reports no previous mental problems. He claims having had a normal childhood in a relatively wealthy family and no academic problems during school or university. He describes himself as very sociable but occasionally vengeful when he feels he has been wronged.
