0,0,0,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Marked symptoms of anxiety accompanied by either:
 general apprehensiveness that is not restricted to any particular environmental circumstance (i.e., “free-floating anxiety”); or
 worry (apprehensive expectation) about untoward events occurring in several different aspects of everyday life (e.g., work, finances, health, family).
  
 Anxiety and general apprehensiveness or worry are accompanied by additional symptoms, such as:
 Muscle tension or motor restlessness.
 Sympathetic autonomic overactivity as evidenced by frequent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and/or abdominal distress, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shaking, and/or dry mouth.
 Subjective experience of nervousness, restlessness, or being “on edge”.
 Difficulties maintaining concentration.
 Irritability.
 Sleep disturbances (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).
  
 The symptoms are not transient and persist for at least several months, for more days than not.
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
  
 
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
  
 Anxiety and worry are normal emotional/cognitive states that commonly occur when people are under stress. At optimal levels, anxiety and worry may help to direct problem-solving efforts, focus attention adaptively, and increase alertness. Normal anxiety and worry are usually sufficiently self-regulated that they do not interfere with functioning or cause marked distress. In contrast, the anxiety and worry characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder are excessive, persistent, intense, and may have a significant negative impact on functioning. Individuals under extremely stressful circumstances (e.g., living in a war zone) may experience intense and impairing anxiety and worry that is appropriate to their environmental circumstances, and these experiences should not be regarded as symptomatic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder if they occur only under such circumstances. (Boundary with normality)
  
 The symptoms are not a manifestation of a medical disorder that is not classified under Mental and Behavioural Disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., coffee, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines). (Boundary with Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder and Anxiety Disorder Due to a Disorder or Disease Classified Elsewhere)
  
 Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depressive Disorders can share several features such as somatic symptoms of anxiety, difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption, and feelings of dread associated with pessimistic thoughts. Depressive Disorders are differentiated by the presence of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other characteristic symptoms of Depressive Disorders (e.g., appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, suicidal ideation). Generalized Anxiety Disorder may co-occur with Depressive Disorders, but should only be diagnosed if the definitional requirements of Generalized Anxiety Disorder were met prior to the onset of or following complete remission of a Depressive Episode. (Boundary with Depressive Disorders)
  
 Adjustment Disorder involves maladaptive reactions to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences. Reactions may include excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications. Adjustment Disorder centers on the identifiable stressor or its consequences, whereas in GAD, worry typically encompasses multiple areas of daily life and may include hypothetical concerns (e.g., that a negative life event may occur). Unlike individuals with GAD, those with Adjustment disorder typically have normal functioning prior to the onset of the stressor(s). Symptoms of Adjustment Disorder generally resolve within 6 months. (Boundary with Adjustment Disorder)
  
 In Social Anxiety Disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g., speaking in public, initiating a conversation) and the primary focus of apprehension is being negatively evaluated by others. Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may worry about the implications of performing poorly or failing an examination, but are not exclusively concerned about being evaluated by others. (Boundary with Social Anxiety Disorder)
  
 Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear or anxiety. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is differentiated by a more persistent and less circumscribed chronic feeling of apprehensiveness usually associated with worry about a variety of different everyday life events. Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may experience panic attacks that are triggered by specific worries. In such cases, an additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder should only be given if the person has also experienced panic attacks without specific provocation (i.e., unexpected panic attacks). Moreover, some individuals with Panic Disorder may experience anxiety and worry between panic attacks. If the focus of the anxiety and worry is confined to fear of having a panic attack or the possible implications of panic attacks (e.g., that the individual may be suffering from a cardiovascular illness), an additional diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not warranted. If, however, the individual is more generally anxious about a number of life events in addition to experiencing unprovoked panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder may be appropriate. (Boundary with Panic Disorder)
  
 Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder develop hypervigilance as a consequence of exposure to the traumatic stressor and may become apprehensive that they or others close to them may be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder may also experience anxiety triggered by reminders of the traumatic event (e.g., fear and avoidance of a place where an individual was assaulted). In contrast, the anxiety and worry in individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder is directed toward the possibility of untoward events in a variety of life domains (e.g., health, finances, work). (Boundary with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder)
  
 In Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, the focus of apprehension is on intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images (obsessions), whereas in Generalized Anxiety Disorder the focus is on everyday life events. In contrast to obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which are usually experienced as unwanted and intrusive, individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may experience their worry as a strategy that is helpful in averting negative outcomes. (Boundary with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)
  
 Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may worry about the health and safety of attachment figures, as in Separation Anxiety Disorder, but their worry also extends to other aspects of everyday life events. (Boundary with Separation Anxiety Disorder)
 
 
 Additional Features:
  
 Some individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may only report chronic somatic anxiety and a feeling of nonspecific dread without being able to articulate specific worry content.
  
 Behavioural changes such as avoidance, frequent need for reassurance (especially in children), and procrastination may be seen. These behaviours typically represent an effort to reduce apprehension or prevent untoward events from occurring.","Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by:
 1. Excessive and intense general apprehensiveness or worry
 2. Persistence and severity that interferes with daily life
 3. Additional physical and psychological symptoms."
1,1,1,Panic Disorder,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Recurrent unexpected panic attacks that are not restricted to particular stimuli or situations. Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension also characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 Palpitations or increased heart rate
 Sweating
 Trembling
 Sensations of shortness of breath
 Feelings of choking
 Chest pain
 Nausea or abdominal distress
 Feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness
 Chills or hot flushes
 Tingling or lack of sensation in extremities (i.e., paresthesias)
 Depersonalization or derealization
 Fear of losing control or going mad
 Fear of imminent death
  
 Panic attacks are followed by persistent concern or worry (e.g., for several weeks) about their recurrence or their perceived negative significance (e.g., that the physiological symptoms may be those of a myocardial infarction), or behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence (e.g., only leaving the home with a trusted companion).
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
  
 Panic attacks can occur in other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders as well as other Mental and Behavioural Disorders and therefore the presence of panic attacks is not in itself sufficient to assign a diagnosis of Panic Disorder.
 
  
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
  
 The sudden onset, rapid peaking, unexpected nature, and intense severity of panic attacks differentiates them from normal situation-bound anxiety that may be experienced in everyday life (e.g., during stressful life transitions such as moving to a new city). Furthermore, Panic Disorder is differentiated from normal fear reactions by frequent recurrence of panic attacks, persistent alterations in behaviour following panic attacks (e.g., avoidance), and associated significant impairment in functioning. Occasionally, an individual may experience a single, isolated panic attack and never experience a recurrence. A diagnosis is not warranted in such cases. (Boundary with normality)
  
 The symptoms are not a manifestation of a medical disorder that is not classified under Mental and Behavioural Disorders (e.g., pheochromocytoma) and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., coffee, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines). (Boundary with Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder and Anxiety Disorder Due to a Disorder or Disease Classified Elsewhere)
  
 Panic attacks can occur in the context of a variety of other Mental and Behavioural Disorders, particularly other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders, Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress, and Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. When panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders, they are generally part of an intense anxiety response to a distressing internal or external stimulus that represents a focus of apprehension in that disorder (e.g., a particular object or situation in Specific Phobia, negative social evaluation in Social Anxiety Disorder, being contaminated by germs in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, having a serious illness in Hypochondriasis, reminders of a traumatic event in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder). If panic attacks are limited to such situations in the context of another disorder, a separate diagnosis of Panic Disorder is not warranted. If some panic attacks over the course of the disorder have been unexpected and not exclusively in response to stimuli associated with the focus of apprehension related to another disorder, an additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder may be assigned. (Boundary with Anxiety Disorders and other Mental and Behavioural Disorders)
  
 The perceived unpredictability of panic attacks often reflects the early phase of the illness. However, over time, with the reoccurrence of panic attacks in specific situations, individuals often develop anticipatory anxiety about having panic attacks in those situations or may experience panic attacks triggered by exposure to them. If the individual develops fears that panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms will occur in multiple situations, and as a result actively avoids these situations, requires the presence of a companion, or endures them only with intense fear or anxiety and all other definitional requirements of Agoraphobia are met, he or she may qualify for an additional diagnosis of Agoraphobia. (Boundary with Agoraphobia)
  
 Individuals with Hypochondriasis often misinterpret bodily symptoms as evidence that they may have one or more life threatening illnesses. Although individuals with Panic Disorder may also manifest concerns that physical manifestations of anxiety are indicative of life threatening illnesses (e.g., myocardial infarction), these symptoms typically occur in the midst of a panic attack. Individuals with Panic Disorder are more concerned about the recurrence of panic attacks or panic-like symptoms, are less likely to report somatic concerns attributable to bodily symptoms other than those associated with anxiety, and are less likely to engage in repetitive and excessive health-related behaviours. However, panic attacks can occur in Hypochondriasis and if they are exclusively associated with fears of having a life-threatening illness, an additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder it not warranted. However, the two disorders can co-occur, and if there are persistent and repetitive panic attacks that are not in response to illness-related concerns, both diagnoses should be assigned. (Boundary with Hypochondriasis)
  
 Panic attacks can occur in Depressive Disorders, particularly in those with Prominent Anxiety Symptoms as well as in Mixed Depressive and Anxiety Disorder, and may be triggered by depressive ruminations. If unexpected panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders and the main concern is about the perceived dangerousness of the panic-like symptoms, an additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder may be appropriate. (Boundary with Depressive Disorders and Mixed Depressive and Anxiety Disorder)
  ​ 
 
 Additional Features:
  
 Individual panic attacks usually only last for minutes, though some may last longer. The frequency and severity of panic attacks varies widely (e.g., many times a day to a few per month) within and across individuals.
  
 Limited-symptom attacks (i.e., attacks that are similar to panic attacks, except that they are accompanied by only a few symptoms characteristic of a panic attack without the characteristic intense peak of symptoms) are common in individuals with Panic Disorder, particularly as behavioural strategies (e.g., avoidance) are used to curtail anxiety symptoms. However, in order to qualify for a diagnosis of Panic Disorder, there must be a history of recurrent panic attacks that meet the full definitional requirements. A diagnosis of Agoraphobia without the additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder can be considered if there is no history of recurrent full symptom panic attacks and all definitional requirements are met for Agoraphobia.
  
 Some individuals with Panic Disorder experience nocturnal panic attacks, that is, waking from sleep in a state of panic.
  
 Although the pattern of symptoms (e.g., mainly respiratory, nocturnal, etc.), the severity of the anxiety, and the extent of avoidance behaviours are variable, Panic Disorder is one of the most impairing of the Anxiety Disorders. Individuals often present repeatedly to emergency units and may undergo a range of unnecessary and costly special medical investigations despite repeated negative findings.",Panic Disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which recurrent unex
2,2,2,Agoraphobia,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in, or in anticipation of, multiple situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, such as using public transportation, being in crowds, being outside the home alone, in shops, theatres, or standing in line.
  
 The individual is consistently fearful or anxious about these situations due to a sense of danger or fear of specific negative outcomes such as panic attacks, symptoms of panic, or other incapacitating (e.g., falling) or embarrassing physical symptoms (e.g., incontinence).
  
 The situations are actively avoided, are entered only under specific circumstances (e.g., in the presence of a companion), or else are endured with intense fear or anxiety.
  
 The symptoms are not transient, that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g., at least several months).
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
 
  
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
  
 Individuals may exhibit transient avoidance behaviours in the context of normal development or in periods of increased stress. These behaviours are differentiated from Agoraphobia because they are limited in duration and do not lead to significant impact on functioning. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Individuals with other medical disorders not classified under Mental and Behavioural Disorders may demonstrate avoidance because of reasonable concerns about being incapacitated (e.g., mobility limitations in an individual with a neurological disorder) or embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). Agoraphobia should only be diagnosed if the fear or anxiety and avoidance result in greater functional impairment as compared to others who have a similar health condition. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Specific Phobia is differentiated from Agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribed situations or stimuli themselves (e.g., heights, animals, blood or injury) rather than fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult. (Boundary with Specific Phobia)
  
 In Social Anxiety Disorder, symptoms in response to feared social situations (e.g., speaking in public, initiating a conversation) and the primary focus of apprehension is on being negatively evaluated by others. (Boundary with Social Anxiety Disorder)
  
 In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, the individual deliberately avoids reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s). In contrast, situations are avoided in Agoraphobia because of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult. (Boundary with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder)
  
 Similar to Agoraphobia, individuals with Separation Anxiety Disorder avoid situations but, in contrast, they do so to prevent or limit being away from individuals to whom they are attached (e.g., parent, spouse, or child) for fear of losing them. (Boundary with Separation Anxiety Disorder)
  
 Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may avoid situations but do so to avert feared negative consequences in everyday life situations (e.g., avoiding going on a family trip because of worries that a family member will get sick) rather than because of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult. (Boundary with Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
  
 Many individuals with Agoraphobia have also experienced recurrent panic attacks. If the panic attacks occur exclusively in the context of the multiple agoraphobic situations without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder is not warranted. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur and all other diagnostic requirements of Panic Disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned. (Boundary with Panic Disorder)
  
 In Depressive Disorders, individuals may avoid mulitple situations but do so because of loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities or due to lack of energy rather than because of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult. (Boundary with Depressive Disorders)
 
 
 Additional Features:
  
 The experiences feared by individuals with Agoraphobia include any of the symptoms of a panic attack as decribed in Panic Disorder (e.g., palpitations or increased heart rate, chest pain, feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness) or other symptoms that may be incapacitating, frightening, difficult to manage, or embarrassing (e.g., incontinence, changes in vision, vomiting).
  
 Individuals with Agoraphobia may employ a variety of different behavioural strategies if required to enter feared situations. One such ‘safety’ behaviour is to require the presence of a companion. Other strategies may include going to certain places only at particular times of day or carrying specific materials (e.g., medications, towels) in case of the feared negative outcome. These strategies may change over the course of the disorder and from one occasion to the next. For example, on different occasions in the same situation an individual may insist on having a companion, endure the situation with distress, or use various safety behaviours to cope with his or her anxiety.
  
 Although the pattern of symptoms, the severity of the anxiety, and the extent of avoidance are variable, Agoraphobia is one of the most impairing of the Anxiety Disorders to the extent that some individuals become completely housebound, which has an impact on opportunities for employment, seeking medical care, and the ability to form and maintain relationships.","Agoraphobia is fear of multiple situations or anticipation of fear/anxiety of dangerous outcomes where escape might be difficult. People with agoraphobia are consistently fearful, have active avoidance, and the symptoms are severe resulting in significant distress and impairment in functioning. This disorder is distinguished from other similar disorders such as social anxiety disorder, panic attack, or generalized anxiety disorder, among others. Agoraphobia may also involve fear of specific negative outcomes such as panic attacks or other symptoms of panic or embarrassing physical symptoms. Additional features such as the use of strategies to cope with the fear and severity of the disorder may vary over time and situations."
3,3,3,Specific Phobia,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs when exposed to one or more specific objects or situations (e.g., proximity to certain kinds of animals, heights, closed spaces, sight of blood or injury) and that is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation.
  
 The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or else endured with intense fear or anxiety.
  
 A pattern of fear, anxiety, or avoidance related to specific objects or situations is not transient, that is, it persists for an extended period of time (e.g., at least several months).
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
 
 
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
 ​
 In children and adolescents, some fears may be part of normal development (e.g., a young child who is afraid of dogs). Specific Phobia should only be diagnosed if the fear or anxiety is excessive in comparison to that of other individuals at a similar developmental level. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Specific Phobia is differentiated from Agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribed situations or stimuli (e.g., heights, animals, blood-injury) rather than because of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult. (Boundary with Agoraphobia)
  
 Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited panic attacks that occur in multiple situations, whereas if panic attacks occur in Specific Phobia, they are the result of excessive fear or anxiety about encountering or anticipating encountering a specific object or situation rather than fear or anxiety about the symptoms of anxiety themselves. (Boundary with Panic Disorder)
  
 In Social Anxiety Disorder, the fear and avoidance is triggered by social situations (e.g., speaking in public, initiating a conversation) and the primary focus of apprehension is on being negatively evaluated by others, whereas in Specific Phobia, the fear and avoidance is in response to other specific objects or situations (Boundary with Social Phobia)
 
 
 Additional Features:
  
 Specific Phobia encompasses fears of a broad and heterogeneous group of phobic stimuli. The most common are for particular animals (animal phobia), heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), sight of blood or injury (blood-injury phobia), flying, driving, storms, darkness, and medical/dental procedures. Individual’s reactions to phobic stimuli can range from feelings of disgust and revulsion (often occurring in animal phobias or blood-injury phobias), anticipation of danger or harm (common across most types of Specific phobia), and physical symptoms such as fainting (most common in response to blood or injury).
  
 The majority of individuals diagnosed with Specific Phobia report fear of multiple objects or situations. A single diagnosis of Specific Phobia is assigned regardless of the number of feared objects or situations. Unlike most phobic stimuli, which upon presentation or anticipation typically result in significant physiological arousal, individuals who fear the sight of blood, invasive medical procedures, or injury, may experience a vasovagal response that can result in a fainting spell.
  
 Some individuals with Specific Phobia may report a history of having observed another person (e.g., caregiver) react with fear or anxiety when confronted by an object or situation resulting in vicarious learning of a fear response to the object or situation or direct negative experience with an object or situation (e.g., having been bitten by a dog). However, previous negative experiences (direct or vicarious) are not necessary for the development of the disorder.
  
 Some individuals report that their fear or anxiety for an object or situation is not excessive. As such, clinicians must consider whether the reported fear, anxiety, or avoidance behaviour is disproportionate to the reasonable risk of harm taking into consideration both accepted cultural norms as well as the specific environmental conditions that the individual is normally subjected to (e.g., fear of darkness may be justified in a neighborhood where assaults are common at night).","Essential Features: Consistently marked and excessive fear of specific objects or situations that are out of proportion to danger. Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety are differentiated by situational factors, severity and context of the symptoms. Specific Phobia includes a wide range of stimuli; common are animal phobia, heights, enclosed spaces, sight of blood or injury. Often, individuals experience anxiety or physical symptoms. Diagnosis is based on self-reported."
4,4,4,Social Anxiety Disorder,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs consistently in one or more social situations such as social interactions (e.g., having a conversation), being observed (e.g., while eating or drinking), or performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).
  
 The individual is concerned that he or she will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e., be humiliating, embarrassing, lead to rejection, or be offensive).
  
 Relevant social situations are consistently avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
  
 The symptoms are not transient; that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g., at least several months).
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
 
  
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
  
 Social Anxiety Disorder can be differentiated from normal developmental fears (e.g., a child’s reluctance to interact with unfamiliar people in novel situations) by fear and anxiety reactions that are typically excessive, interfere with functioning, and persist over time (e.g., lasting more than several months). (Boundary with normality)
  
 Many individuals experience fear in social situations (e.g., it is common for individuals to experience anxiety about public speaking) or manifest the normal personality trait of shyness. Social Anxiety Disorder should only be considered in cases in which the individual reports social fear, anxiety, and avoidance that are clearly in excess of what is normative for the specific cultural context and result in significant distress or impairment. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Individuals with certain medical disorders not classified under Mental and Behavioural Disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease) as well as those with other Mental and Behavioural Disorders (e.g., Schizophrenia) may demonstrate avoidance of social situations because of concerns that others will negatively evaluate their symptoms (e.g., tremor, unusual behaviours). An additional diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder should only be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met taking in to consideration that it is normal for individuals with visible symptoms of a medical disorder to experience some concerns about how others perceive their symptoms. Typically, individuals with medical disorders adapt to concerns related to their manifest symptoms and do not display persistent excessive fear or anxiety in social situations. (Boundary with other Mental and Behavioural Disorders or a Disorder or Disease Classified Elsewhere)
  
 Fear or anxiety in Agoraphobia centers on imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult rather than on concerns that others are negatively evaluating them. Unlike Social Anxiety Disorder, embarrassment in Agoraphobia is secondary to the concerns that escape or obtaining assistance may not be possible should symptoms (e.g., diarrhea in a public place) occur. (Boundary with Agoraphobia)
  
 Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited panic attacks that occur in multiple situations, whereas when panic attacks occur in Social Anxiety Disorder, they are restricted to social situations. However, Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder are frequently comorbid and if definitional requirements for both disorders are met both can be diagnosed. (Boundary with Panic Disorder)
  
 Specific Phobia can be differentiated from Social Anxiety Disorder because, in general, fears are of specific situations or stimuli (e.g., heights, animals, blood-injury) that are not social contexts. (Boundary with Specific Phobia)

 Selective Mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations whereas in Social Anxiety Disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts. If definitional requirements of both disorders are met, both can be diagnosed. (Boundary with Selective Mutism)
  
 Beliefs of social inadequacy, rejection, and failure are common in Depressive Disorders and may be associated with avoidance of social situations. However, unlike in Social Anxiety Disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively during a Depressive Episode. (Boundary with Depressive Disorders)
 
 
 Additional Features:
  
 Individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder may report concerns about physical symptoms, such as blushing, sweating, or trembling rather than initially endorsing fears of negative evaluation.
  
 Social Anxiety Disorder is highly comorbid with other Anxiety Disorders as well as Depressive Disorders.
  
 Individuals with Social Phobia are at higher risk for developing Substance Use Disorders, which may arise subsequent to use for the purposes of attenuating anxiety symptoms in social situations.
  
 Individuals may not view their fear or anxiety in response to social situations as excessive. As such, clinical judgment should be applied to determine whether the reported fear, anxiety, and/or avoidance behaviour is disproportionate to what the social situation warrants taking into consideration both accepted cultural norms as well as the specific environmental conditions that the individual is normally subjected to (e.g., fear of interacting with peers may be appropriate if the individual is being bullied).","A psychiatric disorder is social anxiety where fear and anxiety are excessive in social situations, persist over time, and lead to impairment. It differs from personality trait shyness and must be diagnosed in cases where there is significant distress and impairment. It is distinguished from agoraphobia, panic disorder, Specific Phobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism, and Depressive Disorders. Individuals with social anxiety disorder may have physical symptoms and it is highly comorbid with other anxiety and depressive disorders. Some individuals may not view their symptoms as disproportionate to the social situation."
5,5,5,Separation Anxiety Disorder,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person is attached (i.e., has a deep affective bond with). In children and youth, attachment figures are typically parents, caregivers, or other family members, whereas in adults, they are most often a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’s developmental level, but may include:
 Persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g., being kidnapped) will lead to separation.
 Reluctance or refusal to go to school or work.
 Recurrent excessive distress (e.g., tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separated from the attachment figure.
 Reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure.
 Recurrent nightmares about separation.
 Physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomachache, headache, on occasions that involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to school or work.
  
 The symptoms are not transient, that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g., at least several months).
  
 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
  
 
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
 ​
 Many situations involving separation are associated with other potential stressors or are normal sources of anxiety (e.g., leaving home to start a job or attend university in a new city). Separation Anxiety Disorder is differentiated based on the focus of the anxiety being on separation from a key attachment figure rather than on other aspects of adjusting to novel circumstances. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Strong attachment to loved ones is a normal and healthy part of life and separation from these individuals may be associated with transient sadness or anxiety. Preschool children may show a moderate or even greater degree of anxiety over real or threatened separation from people to whom they are attached. These reactions are considered developmentally appropriate and differentiated from Separation Anxiety Disorder on the basis of the persistence of the symptoms (e.g., lasting for several months) with repeated separations, evidence of excessive preoccupations about the well being of attachment figures, persistent avoidance, and significant distress or impairment in functioning as a consequence of the symptoms. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Among children and youth, school refusal is a common occurrence and may be based on transient anxiety about separation from a loved one or be symptomatic of Separation Anxiety Disorder. However, especially in adolescence, anxiety about school or school refusal is not typically related to fear of separation but rather to other factors such as truancy, peer rejection, or bullying. (Boundary with Normality)
  
 In Agoraphobia, individuals avoid a variety of situations including leaving home alone but the fear or anxiety is centred on the possibility that help will not be available in the event of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms rather than concerns about separation from key attachment figures. (Boundary with Agoraphobia)
  
 Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited panic attacks that occur in multiple situations, whereas when panic attacks occur in Separation Anxiety Disorder, they are restricted to situations when the individual is faced with or is anticipating separation from a key attachment figure.

 In Social Anxiety Disorder, the avoidance of social situations is in response to fear or anxiety about being negatively evaluated by others rather than concerns about being separated from key attachment figures. (Boundary with Social Phobia)
  
 In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, individuals have a history of exposure to a traumatic event that may have involved the loss of a key attachment figure. However, the focus of apprehension is on intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic event from memory and avoidance of associated stimuli rather than concerns about future loss of or harm coming to the key attachment figure. However, Separation Anxiety Disorder rather than Posttraumatic Stress Disorder may occur subsequent to the experience of a traumatic event and if all definitional requirements are met the diagnosis can be assigned. (Boundary with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder)
  
 Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder experience chronic and excessive worry about a variety of everyday life events that can include preoccupation about the safety of key attachment figures. However, these concerns seldom occur without additional worries regarding other domains of everyday life (Boundary with Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
  
 Beliefs of social inadequacy, rejection, and failure are common in Depressive Disorders and may be associated with avoidance of leaving the home and being separated from loved ones. However, unlike in Separation Anxiety Disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively during a Depressive Episode. (Boundary with Depressive Disorders)
  
 Individuals with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) can exhibit similar behaviours as those observed in Separation Anxiety Disorder such as anger, irritability, and temper outbursts and/or defiant and headstrong behaviour (e.g., refusal to leave home or go to school). However, in Separation Anxiety Disorder these occur exclusively as a result of anticipated or actual separation from a key attachment figure. School refusal or truancy may occur in the context of Conduct Disorder but the behaviour is not related to concerns for the well-being of a key attachment figure. (Boundary with Disruptive Behaviour and Dissocial Disorders)
  
 Fear of abandonment or dependency on others can occur as symptoms of an enduring maldapative pattern of behaviour associated with a Personality Disorder. These symptoms tend to occur with other broader disruptions to interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, as well as identity formation and definition. Personality Disorders may co-occur with Separation Anxiety Disorder and if present, can be diagnosed separately. (Boundary with Personality Disorder)
 
 ​
 Additional Features:
  
 Separation Anxiety Disorder is frequently comorbid with other Mental and Behavioural Disorders. In children and youth, common comorbidities include Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia. In adults, frequent comorbidities include Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Personality Disorders.
  
 Although Separation Anxiety Disorder may exhibit a lifelong course with onset in childhood, a significant proportion of adult individuals with Separation Anxiety Disorder do not recall a childhood onset.
  
 Separation Anxiety Disorder in childhood is frequently associated with a parenting style that interferes with the development of autonomy and self-mastery expected for that person’s cultural context (e.g., parent does not permit child to independently engage in basic activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing).","Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is necessary/required in essential features to marked excessive fear/anxiety when separated from a deep affective bond. Manifestations of such fear depend on age and developmental level. Children and youth attach to parents/caregivers; adults attach to romantic partners/children. Symptoms persist for months, result in significant distress, and impair functioning. Boundary with agoraphobia, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and personality disorder."
6,6,6,Selective Mutism,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 Consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates adequate language competence in specific social situations, typically at home, but consistently fails to speak in others, typically at school.
  
 The duration of the disturbance is at least one month, not limited to the first month of school.
  
 The disturbance is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language demanded in the social situation.
  
 Selectivity of speech is sufficiently severe so as to interfere with educational achievement or with social communication or is associated with significant impairment in other important areas of functioning.
 
  
 Boundaries with Other Disorders and Normality:
  
 Transient reluctance to speak at the time of first starting school is a common occurrence. Selective Mutism should only be diagnosed if symptoms persist beyond the first month of schooling. Immigrant children who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in the official language of their new host country may, for a discrete period of time, refuse to speak to strangers in their new environment. This may also occur with children from linguistic minorities. Selective Mutism should not be diagnosed in such cases. (Boundary with normality)
  
 Selective Mutism is differentiated from the range of Developmental Speech and Language Disorders (i.e., Language Disorders or Speech Fluency Disorder) that involve impairments in expressive language across all social situations. Although some children with Selective Mutism exhibit expressive language difficulties or phonological problems, these are often subtle and functioning is usually found to be in the normal range. Selective Mutism may occur in the presence of Developmental Speech and Language Disorders and both can be diagnosed if warranted. (Boundary with Developmental Communication Disorders)
  
 Some individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder or Disorders of Intellectual Development exhibit impairments in language and social communication. However, unlike in Selective Mutism, when language and communication impairments are present in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Disorders of Intellectual Development, they are notable across environments and social situations. (Boundary with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Disorders of Intellectual Development)
  
 Selective Mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations whereas in Social Anxiety Disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts. If definitional requirements of both disorders are met, both can be diagnosed. (Boundary with Social Anxiety Disorder)
 
  
 Additional Features:
  
 Symptoms of Selective Mutism may interfere with direct assessment of expressive language. However, many affected children cooperate with receptive language testing if communication is restricted to carrying out commands or pointing to pictures, which can provide valuable information about a child’s general language levels. Furthermore, reports from informants who know the child well (e.g., parent or caregiver) may be necessary to establish that the child can speak in certain social situations.
  
 Selective Mutism is often regarded as a variant of Social Anxiety Disorder because affected individuals experience significant anxiety in social situations and when able to express themselves indicate that they fear negative evaluation, in particular of their speech. However, unlike Social Anxiety Disorder, children with Selective Mutism are more likely to display these difficulties at an earlier age of onset (in most cases before the age of 5 years but may only become apparent when starting school), be more likely to have associated subtle language impairments, and exhibit oppositional behaviour in response to being asked to speak in feared situations.
  
 Comorbidity with Anxiety Disorders (particularly Social Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, and Specific Phobias) is very high among individuals with Selective Mutism.
  
 Selective Mutism is associated with severe impairment in academic and social functioning that can manifest as inability to complete expected school work, not getting personal needs met, inability to initiate or reciprocate social interactions with peers, and/or becoming the target of bullying.
  
 Social anxiety, withdrawal, and avoidance in Selective Mutism may be related to temperamental factors such as behavioural inhibition and negative affectivity.","### Essential (Required) Features for diagnosing Selective Mutism include consistent selectivity in speaking, duration beyond the first month of school, and significant impairment in functioning. Transient reluctance to speak is not considered diagnostic. The diagnosis is differentiated from other communication disorders by the presence of specific social situations and subtle impairments. Selective Mutism may overlap with Autism Spectrum Disorder and social anxiety. Symptoms can affect academic and social functioning and may be related to temperamental factors."
7,7,7,Other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorder,"Essential (Required) Features:
  
 The clinical presentation does not satisfy the definitional requirements of any other disorder in the Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders grouping.
  
 The symptoms are not better explained by another Mental and Behavioural Disorder (e.g., a psychotic, mood, or obsessive-compulsive and related disorder).
  
 The clinical presentation is judged to be a Mental and Behavioural Disorder that shares primary clinical features with other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders (e.g., physiological symptoms of excessive arousal, apprehension, and avoidance behaviour).
  
 The symptoms are not developmentally appropriate.
  
 The symptoms are in excess of what is normative for the individual’s specific cultural context.
  
 The symptoms and behaviours are not explained by another medical disorder that is not classified under Mental and Behavioural Disorders.
  
 The symptoms cause significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","The clinical presentation meets the criteria for an Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorder, as it is within the same group of disorders, shares primary features, and is not adequately explained by other disorders or medical conditions."
8,8,8,Unspecified Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorder,(No specific diagnostic guidance provided.),"A diagnostic evaluation provided by a healthcare provider can identify the cause of your symptoms through various testing procedures and imaging scans. The healthcare provider may also recommend treatment options based on the diagnosis. However, specific diagnostic guidance may not be provided without a proper evaluation."
